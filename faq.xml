<qandaentry>
<question><para>How is "RELAX NG" pronounced?</para></question>
<answer><para>It's pronounced "relaxing".</para></answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>Why does RELAX NG use an XML syntax?</para></question>
<answer><para>
	Seriously, is there any other choice?
</para><para>
	If you don't want to write RELAX NG in XML syntax, there is <ulink href="http://thaiopensource.com/relaxng/nonxml/">a tool by James Clark</ulink> that allows you to write RELAX NG schema in non-XML syntax and that tool will convert it to XML syntax for you.
</para></answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>Why is RELAX NG so verbose?</para></question>
<answer>
	<para>
		If you find it too verbose for hand writing, there are tools that let you write one in more concise syntax. Check out the tools section.
	</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>What about entity declarations? Why doesn't RELAX NG
allow me to declare entities? What do I do if I need to declare an
entity?</para></question>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>What about notation declarations? Why doesn't RELAX NG
allow me to declare notations? What do I do if I need to declare a
notation?</para></question>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>Why doesn't RELAX NG do type assignment?  How can I
use RELAX NG if I want to do schema-based type
assignment?</para></question>
<answer><para>
	Actually you can do the type assignment if you use a tool that supports it.
	For example, Sun Multi-Schema XML Validator supports the type assignment.
</para></answer>
<answer><para>
	Since RELAX NG allows ambiguous grammars, type-assignment is not always possible. And in some other cases, type-assignment is possible but needs multiple passes. That's one of the reasons why we don't have type-assignment in our core spec.
</para></answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>How can I do data-binding with RELAX
NG?</para></question>
<answer><para>
	There are not many, but there certainly exists tools for data-binding.
	For one, you can use Relaxer. Check out the tools section for more.
</para></answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>Why should I care about RELAX NG when I have
DTDs?</para></question>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>What about ID/IDREF? Why doesn't RELAX NG do ID/IDREF?
What do I do if I need ID/IDREF?</para></question>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>Why doesn't RELAX NG provide a feature like key,
keyRef in XML Schema? What do I do if I need this
functionality?</para></question>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>Why doesn't RELAX NG provide a
<literal>documentation</literal> element?</para></question>
<answer>
	<para>
		If you want to write documentation in RELAX NG schema, you can do it by simply using a namespace of your choice, like this:
	</para>
	<programlisting><![CDATA[
<element xmlns:doc="my:own:choice:of:namespace:URI">
  <anyName/>
  <doc:document>
    Here is my documentation
  </doc:document>
  ...
</element>
	]]></programlisting>
	<para>
		RELAX NG allows you to write any elements and attributes to anywhere as long as it belongs to the namespace other than the RELAX NG namespace. So the above is completely legal.
	</para><para>
		Or another way to do this is to use elements of XHTML, DocBook, TEI or whatsoever.
		In this way, you can format your documents quite nicely.
	</para>
	<programlisting><![CDATA[
<element xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml">
  <anyName/>
  <xhtml:div>
    <xhtml:h1>Overview of this element</xhtml:h1>
    <xhtml:p>This element is used to do some craptacular thing</xhtml:p>
  </xhtml:div>
  ...
</element>
	]]></programlisting>
	<para>
		If you are looking for a plain simple text-only documentation, then you may want to use the documentation tag specified in the "RELAX NG DTD compatibility specification". No, you don't need to read the spec. Just use the <literal>documentation</literal> element in the
		<literal>http://relaxng.org/ns/annotation/0.9</literal> namespace. For example,
	</para>
	<programlisting><![CDATA[
<element xmlns:a="http://relaxng.org/ns/annotation/0.9">
  <anyName/>
  <a:documentation>
    This element is used to save the world from starvation.
  </a:documentation>
  ...
</element>
	]]></programlisting>
	<para>
		As I wrote earlier, you can write this element anywhere in the schema.
	</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>I read that RELAX NG is based on "regular tree
languages"? What's that all about? Does it have any practical
benefits?</para></question>
<answer>
	<para>
		As long as you are using RELAX NG, you don't need to know anything
		about those geeky stuff. But yes, it does have several practical
		benefits.
	</para>
	<orderedlist>
		<listitem><para>
			The validation algorithm becomes simple because this theory is 
			well-studied. This contributes to make validators smaller and faster.
		</para></listitem>
		<listitem><para>
			It enables static analysis of schemas: is anything allowed by one schema
			also allowed by another schema?
		</para></listitem>
	</orderedlist>
</answer>
</qandaentry>


<qandaentry>
<question><para>Why does RELAX NG base itself on grammars?  Isn't a
constraint-based approach like Schematron more
powerful?</para></question>

<answer>
	<para>
		One answer to this question is, the grammar-based approach is well-studied by scientists and (therefore) the validation is relatively fast.
	</para>
	<para>
		Also, there will be tools available which let you combine RELAX NG and Schematron. Check out the tools section.
	</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>What about the XML Schema
<literal>processContents="strict|lax|skip"</literal> feature? How can
I do this in RELAX NG?</para></question>
<answer>
	<para>
		There is no special primitive for the wild card in RELAX NG, but you
		can use the "name class" to achieve the same effect. 
	</para><para>
		Generally, "skip" is easy to mimic, but "strict" and "lax" are hard.
		For example, the following pattern corresponds with:
	</para>
	<programlisting><![CDATA[<any processContents="skip" namespace="##other"/>]]></programlisting>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
<define name="wildcard.skipOther">
  <element>
    <anyName>
      <except><nsName/></except>
    </anyName>
    
    <zeroOrMore>
      <choice>
        <text/>
        <attribute><anyName/></attribute>
        <ref name="wildcard.skipOther"/>
      </choice>
    </zeroOrMore>
  </element>
</define>
]]></programlisting>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>What about exclusions (as in SGML)? Why doesn't RELAX
NG support exclusions? What do I do if I need this
functionality?</para></question>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>Why doesn't RELAX NG support minOccurs/maxOccurs as
XML Schema?</para></question>
<answer>
	<para>
		If you really want to use minOccurs/maxOccurs, you can use
		a tool like
		<ulink href="http://www.geocities.com/kohsukekawaguchi/relaxng/shorthand/ShortRNG.html"
			>this</ulink>, which recognizes
		minOccurs/maxOccurs and expand it to the normal RELAX NG syntax.
	</para>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>(Something about namespaces.  Why does RELAX NG take
the approach that it does? How does RELAX Namespace fit in? Compare
with W3C Schema approach.)</para></question>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>(Something about attribute/element content
models.)</para></question>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>I read that, unlike DTDs and XML Schema, RELAX NG does
not prohibit ambiguous content models? Does this have any practical
benefit?</para></question>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>What's the use of the <literal>interleave</literal>
element in RELAX NG?</para></question>
<answer>
	<para>
		One of the frequent use would be to implement an unordered content model
		( XML Schema's &lt;all&gt; particle.)
	</para><para>
		Another nice technique is to implement a "set" of tokens.
	</para>
<programlisting><![CDATA[
<list>
  <interleave>
    <optional>
      <value>abc</value>
    </optional><optional>
      <value>def</value>
    </optional><optional>
      <value>ghi</value>
    </optional>
  </interleave>
</list>
]]></programlisting>
</answer>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>What's the use of the <literal>parentRef</literal>
element in RELAX NG?  What's the use of nested
grammars?</para></question>
</qandaentry>

<qandaentry>
<question><para>What's the use of the <literal>combine</literal> attribute in RELAX
NG?</para></question>
<answer>
	<para>
		Practically, <literal>combine="choice"</literal> and
		<literal>combine="interleave"</literal> serve two
		completely different purposes.
	</para>
	<itemizedlist>
		<listitem>
			<para>
				One of the use case of <literal>combine="choice"</literal> is
				to create an implicit "class" of elements.
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
<define name="inline.class" combine="choice">
  <element name="b"> ... </element>
</define>

<define name="inline.class" combine="choice">
  <element name="i"> ... </element>
</define>
]]></programlisting>
			<para>
				In this way, each element can collaboratively form a class of elements,
				without any central control. This is useful when writing a modularized schema.
			</para>
		</listitem><listitem>
			<para>
				Another common use of <literal>combine="choice"</literal> is
				to extend an already defined "class" of elements.
			</para>
			<programlisting><![CDATA[
<define name="list.class">
  <choice>
    <ref name="dl"/>
    <ref name="ul"/>
    <ref name="ol"/>
  </choice>
</define>

<define name="list.class" combine="choice">
  <ref name="xl"/>
</define>		
			]]></programlisting>
		</listitem>
	</itemizedlist>
